# object_oriented_programming_cpp
A Twitter like terminal based app using C++ and the rules of Object Oriented Programming (OOP). Was created for our University Project. (There is also Java edition of the same project). The report is in Greek. Run `main.cpp` to test it. It is recommended to use an IDE because of the multiple files e.g. Visual Studio.
