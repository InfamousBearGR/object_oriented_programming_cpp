# object_oriented_programming_cpp
A Twitter like terminal based app using C++ and the rules of Object Oriented Programming (OOP). Was created for our University Project. (There is also a Java edition of the same project). Run `main.cpp` to test it. It is recommended to use an IDE because of the multiple files e.g. Visual Studio. Note that we use system commands, so the app doesn't exactly work on Linux.
